I’m a product designer currently working at frog, the design agency with a background in architecture and experience design. I make tech and digital products useful and delightful to use as I employ human psychology to craft interactions. 

Other than that, I’m a keen learner, I’m interested in football, f1, archery, reading and astronomy. I love to dabble in code and writing.
