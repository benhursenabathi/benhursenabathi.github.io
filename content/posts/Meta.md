Meta is quickly becoming a new name and is becoming synonymous with the infamous metaverse we all seem to be raving about. It remains to be seen how meta, the former facebook brand is updated with new business models surrounding the metaverse and if it would follow the best ethical and privacy friendly practices it has failed to do so far.

## Centralised vs Decentralised metaverses
Meta prides itself on building the next generation immersive 3D experiences with avatars for work and leisure. They also know that human limitations as described in my other article is a possibility and we won’t be interacting for long hours with these immersive 3D worlds. 

However, there is a small difference which many people might oversee. Meta is not or should not be synonymous with the metaverse because the company is building a centralised version of the metaverse. Think of apple’s and Google’s App Store. They control what comes in, what goes out and how much piece of the pie they take for every transaction. Centralised services like Apple and Google provide a service, hosting apps and games on their platform marketplace and in turn take in 30% of the revenue for every transaction. Meta is planning to take 50% of every transactions on its service. This would mean, the hardware “Oculus Quest” and software (Metaverse world and avatars” are all controlled by one single entity. 

There are decentralised metaverses being built by communities like Bloktopia, Decentraland and Victoria VR where the worlds operate based on their own tokens but those tokens (BLOK) can be traded on public crypto exchanges for fiat money if you want to cash out and call it a day. These worlds allow you to use the NFTs that are available on your connected wallet. Meta has to provide a metaverse experience that is far superior to these community driven projects since it is centralised. They probably know this and its interesting to see what they come up with. Maybe they succumb to pressure and allow public wallet access instead of using their own marketplace within their metaverse? But that would raise the question of how they would profit from such a business model.  

## Monopoly
One of the scariest parts of meta is how much monopoly they have over the future 3D experiences. The Oculus is already cheaper than a console and has outsold the Xbox last year. Combining this affordable hardware and widespread software, meta can hold a strong monopoly and force users to use its own platform.

Even if decentralised metaverses provide an open and free experience, meta has the power of huge product teams that can take ideas from 0-1 quickly and iterate on it. It can crush decentralised metaverse teams just by the rapid pace of innovation and development. This would be WhatsApp and Instagram all over again. They might not be the best, but they work and work really well and many people are already on it. Meta can use their own platforms of over 2 Billion users to push its own products and metaverse experiences. 

For comparison, have you ever seen apple allowing any other providers the ability to advertise free trials on the settings menu of an iPhone? They can easily do that for their own products like below.

Even if there is a competitor for apple fitness, they can’t win the market with their marketing because apple’s marketing is based on an operating system level. It’s embedded. 

This is where meta has a true advantage.
1. They got the right design and dev teams 
2. They got the existing infrastructure to tap into a huge audience to make the metaverse mainstream 
3. They can easily hold power over the transactions in the metaverse. 

## Locking you in. No exit strategy.
There are many products that do this mostly through user generated data. Often, products uses freemium model which entices users to try and start using a trial or a free product for a few days, hoping that the user starts using it enough, so that they feel locked in and unable to leave, eventually ending in subscriptions. From Spotify’s perfect playlist algorithm to Notion’s abysmal markdown export feature but perfect import feature, they’re all designed to lock a user in. Of course, it doesn’t really matter as long as you, the user finds value in these platforms. But what if notion, removed access to your notion account. What about your data? They eventually own all the content that you generate within it.

Likewise, what about the assets and content created by the community in meta’s metaverse. Who would be having ownership to those information and what would the privacy policy be since its all happening in real time in 3D. Meta has not had the best press when it comes to privacy and it has been building a metaverse-for-work platform. What could meta’s long term strategy be in this case? 

Would meta’s metaverse allow you to export your coins, avatar info and assets to other metaverses or is their platform going to be designed in a way that makes it free but your data is useless if you want to use it outside meta. 

Couple of ways this can be done is using proprietary data formats, custom image and 3D asset formats like Adobe. Every content you generate within these worlds will be completely controlled by the provider and it would be hard for the user to export their information outside. It’s going to be interesting to see if meta decides to tackle these issues and thereby provide a new and better metaverse, one that everyone is hoping for or if they stick to their old ways, like other products and make it hard or impossible to leave.

Keen to hear everyone’s thoughts on this.
