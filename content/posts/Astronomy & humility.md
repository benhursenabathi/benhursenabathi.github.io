300,000 years ago when the first homo sapien set foot on the plains of Africa, little did it know that someday, it would bring the whole of planet Earth under its clutches. It did not know it would mass murder billions of animals for meat, it did not know it had the power to alter the climate and cause widespread destruction on a global scale.

We, humans have evolved to become the dominant species of a planet in a small period when compared to the cosmic timeline. We are learning now that our actions have caused huge environmental changes and we are pushing to further our development as a dominant species by embracing space travel.
But, should we take a step back from all this and pause for a moment a think about our place in the universe to appreciate what we have and how privileged our existence is, not because we humans are any more special than other animals but because we can experience the universe itself and make sense of it.

> We are the universe experiencing itself — Carl Sagan

## Let us take a moment and look at the starry night sky
In all this fiasco of running around, working multiple jobs, planning career jumps, worrying about our loved ones and always feeling tired at the end of the day with nowhere to go but, straight to more cognitive load inducing computers, smartphones, and other gadgets, we exist. In a way, we are complicating our existence not because we want to but because we feel that we need to.

Even though it was proven back in the 16th century that we are not the center of the universe; from a philosophical standpoint, we are under the illusion of importance. We imagine ourselves to be the center of the universe and due to this, we must take a break from time to time to rethink of our role in the cosmic scale. But, how do we do this?
I’m not advocating that you go and order different astronomical equipment straight from amazon or build a rocket. What I’m saying is, let us take a few minutes of our everyday life and observe the night sky with our friends and family. Our biological imperative naturally makes us connect to the night sky because we are observing something that we are a small part of. It is programmed in our DNA and it has been with us since ancestral times. Historically, even with our recent accomplishments in space science, this is the generation of humans which is the least bit bothered about the philosophical implications of outer space. Many of us have been conditioned from childhood to think light of these affinities and to go on with our busy and hectic life.

### What happens when we do this?
As you spend a few minutes every day looking and interpreting the night sky, something changes your mindset. You see the world not how you want to but for what it is. You cherish the time you have with your loved ones and you know that the small blip; which you are in the cosmic timeline is all about being humble and caring for one another. You take most of the problems that you have in your life as slightly less demanding and you appreciate the beauty of existence. You know that nothing is going to matter in the grand scale of cosmos and it might make you depressed at first; but, you will learn to get past it and appreciate life. You learn the ultimate form of humility. In the below image, which shows the universe from the big bang (January) to the present (December) in the form of cosmic calendar. As Humans, our existence is a blip in the timescale of 10:30PM to 12:00AM on 31st of December. That’s how important we have been in a cosmic scale.
