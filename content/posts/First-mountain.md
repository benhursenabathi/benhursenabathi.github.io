# Off topic
This one is going to be an off topic from the usual tech babble that I put up on here. It’s about the philosophical and experiential approach to conquering something that looks to be impossible on the surface. 

## The Climb
We decided to do a midnight mountain climbing cause why not. Triple the danger and triple the experience right? We started at around 8 PM in summer when the sun was strong and the golden rays were reflecting off the lakes. I was secretly hoping that it would be clear skies up at the top so I can finally do some good old stargazing ✨

## The Experience 
The first 300m was absolute pain. Having hiked the whole day, I was not ready (I thought so). The first 300m made me feel the absolute crushing weight and pain I was putting my body through. Times like these reminded me of my football training when I was younger, when the next step was all that matters because that is what your conscious mind can comprehend at that level of exhaustion. If you want to keep going, you just need to think of that next step and not look at how far you have to go. 

I wasn’t even at 300m and my mentality was forcing me to look at the top, gaze at its wonder and say to myself “How am I going to do this?” “Did I make a mistake choosing to do this” 
I guess, in all parts of our lives when we do something of our own accord and not listen to the advice from other people, we always get this doubt at some point. 

> What if I fail and everyone mocks me

This is the point where I learnt, you have to keep pushing. The next step is all that matters and you keep hoping that things will get easier. And guess what? It did get easier. 

I was slow up until 400m and from 550m, my mind and body were at sync. I knew there was no going back now cause it would be the same amount of effort. I saw others starting to slow down and finally I was presented with this amazing view at the middle of the climb. There was, for a few moments, the sun piercing through the dark night clouds in a circular shape and blessing the five of us with its light while the whole other parts of the mountain was dark. It was one of the most amazing things I experienced and felt like I was being abducted by aliens, but frankly, if it were true, I would’ve gave in to the aliens cause I was just too tired.

At 600m I was picking up the pace. My mindset was strong now. I knew that I could do it because I have done it for a while. My body and mind weren’t at odds with one another anymore. I felt like I was the Cassini space-craft flying across Saturn’s orbits, feeling insignificant objectively when I looked at the size but feeling like the most important subjectively being in the universe at the same time. Surreal. 

The last bits were the hardest moments I’ve put myself through and it was foggy, misty and scary at the top. You could not see anything. If you ventured a few feet away from the middle, you will not have any idea where the cliffs are and that could be your end. 

We saw the cairns left behind by other climbers and it was refreshing to relate these cairns to the ones you could find on Skyrim or the Witcher if you’ve played these games. At the summit, we had some cake and food while we tried to stargaze although the skies weren’t much clear. It was finally dark by now and we started to descend. 

## The descent 
Doing this for the first time, I assumed the descent would be the easier option but nope! Getting down was even more tiring on my knees and ankles which were sore by now. Adding the additional weight of your bags and the fear of slipping fuels the adrenaline to pump throughout your body. Imagine floating around in nothingness with a small thread to follow.. that was how the descent felt like. Looking down at the uniquely spaced and sized rock formation and trusting that your knees and body can handle each step of the way until you can reach the bottom safely was hard. It was the first time in my life where I learnt to focus for extended periods of hours with throbbing pain because you know your life is on the line. It’s amazing what the human body is capable of when it senses a dangerous situation. Your vision becomes focussed and your mind becomes clear. You cease to think about the insignificant thoughts and fears that haunt you in your daily life. In the few hours of the descent, you just take it all in, take the surrounding lights from the nearby cities and towns, admire the stars, have a good time with others and take in the fresh cool breeze since it gets 1°c colder for every 100m you’ve climbed.

Feels like almost everyone should experience something like this every now and then to put things into perspective that no matter what we do and where we are, we are capable of doing great things ands still say that we are collectively insignificant at the cosmic scale.
