## Why today is the best day to become a Experience Designer

Many of us have made the transition from different design disciplines to UX for various reasons. Intrinsically when we all started out, we were told that it was a rewarding and fulfilling career to solve real world problems in the domains that interested us.

This still holds true today and I truly believe that there aren’t many fulfilling roles today as an Experience Designer. It comes at a price of learning everyday and staying updated with trends, methods, collaborating with cross functional teams but, like every designer, you still get that feeling of bliss when you ship something and it makes it out to the real world where millions and millions of people are benefitted by it.

## Things to look forward to as a UX designer
### Blockchain and future technologies
It’s becoming more and more clear that as designers, we have to stay on top of the trends where cutting edge innovations happen. For those who are passionate about designing for the next billion users or create products that are going to be pivotal in shaping the world for the next decade especially in crucial domains like education, government, healthcare and finance, blockchain is a key topic to be understood at least at a basic level.

The decentralised economy and frictionless transactions is upon us and we need to be adaptive and knowledgable as designers to implement such technologies in our products for our users in the future. As our role exists at the bridge between ideas, users and finished products, there are not many roles that get to be at the forefront of these technological innovations that might change the world in the next 25 years like a UX Designer. We need to vigilant and grateful for the opportunity to learn and grow in these technologies so that we could use them to help our users attain their goals.

Designing for blockchain in sectors like education, healthcare can disrupt today’s workflows. We are finally designing technologies that are helping progress in vertical innovation. This level of technological innovation has not been seen since the advent of Internet itself and we get to build all these amazing products of the future.

### Sustainability, Circular Design
Gone are the days where you just make paper sketches, test them with a bunch of users and ship a drop shadow filled UI. As UX Designers, we are required to have systems thinking approach to the problems in our projects. This approach ensures that we think about sustainability and eco-friendly practices by thinking holistically.

As designers, having the responsibility to change the course of the world through our products is something we need to be grateful about. Today, as a UX Designer, you are changing the world through your ideas by keeping the users at core.

With the inclusion of service design, Design at the heart can improve the lives of not only the end users, but also the service stakeholders, support workers to lead a better life

### Next Billion Users
According to google, a wave of next billion users will get their hands on a smartphone with proper internet access before 2025. These users, based on predictions, would be from low income groups, less formal education and less developed areas of the world. Would designing for these users need more research that does not follow the standard patterns? Would we need to think about systemic problems like technological infrastructure constraints or use future technologies to circumvent these issues? Only time will tell.

One thing is for sure is that we as, experience designers have another responsibility to make this introduction to internet services for these next billion users be seamless and easy to use. New challenges and new responsibilities are on the verge for experience designers and we need to adapt and learn from our methods. We need to constantly question our processes and learn if they are providing the best value for our users or are we just using them because they have been used everywhere? One more reason as to why, learning and constantly being updated in the platforms

### Service Design to solve societal problems
Service Designers are in demand at the moment because different organisations like government, education and healthcare are recognising the value they bring to the table. Traditional workflows and stakeholder relationships are on the verge of needing crucial optimisation by bringing in new or improved technologies or entirely design a new system.

See how Snook, a service design agency helped neighbourhood watch to bring a community led approach to prevent fraud using local volunteers. Working on projects that enforce your core beliefs while making the lives of the people better is definitely a good incentive isn’t it? As an experience and service designer, you get to learn the problems that people face on a societal level and in a few months, you are on the front seat to witness that problem being solved incrementally. Isn’t that rewarding?

### Personal Expression
Take a few minutes to think how many job titles allows you to work in any domain as a creative? Not many right?

As an experience designer, you get to choose the industries and sectors to express yourself and make your mark. Care about redefining what banking means to create better fintech products? You can become a UX Designer in fintech. Care about social design? There’s opportunities as a service designer for social causes. Want to work in future technologies that promote sustainability? There’s endless startups for that as well with a huge demand for experience designers.

You have this skill set and knowledge that you can impart in any industry to bring innovation at a human-centric level and express yourself. There’s no limit to what you can do once you have experience with multiple industries with different stakeholders.

### Convergent Design
Convergent Design as quoted from frogs creative lead Ian lee, Convergent design weaves together three historically siloed domains–product, service and digital–to create the next generation of experiences, ecosystems and organizations.
