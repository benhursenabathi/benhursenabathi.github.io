### What is bear?
#### Bear is a productivity / notes app
Bear is an incredibly powerful text-editor that is made by a small team from Germany. The attention to detail, privacy and encryption, the relative speed is what drove me to use bear. I’ve been using notion for two years now and one fine day, they decided to lock me out of my account when I lost access to my email (I had an email and password setup to login) Notion does not have a way to recover your account if you lose access to the email. I ended up pleading with their support team for a month and I finally realised my data is gone with notion servers. That made me switch to products across my entire workflow that allowed me to own my own data in case something goes wrong. 

I spent a few weeks organising my notes and trying out new products that could be integrated into my new workflow. That’s when I met [bear](bear.app)Bear is incredibly powerful and let’s see how I use it in my workflow. 

## What is bear used for? 
- Writing blog posts
- Writing meeting notes
- Quick jot downs and thoughts 
- Daily journal 
- Collecting information and making bear as a second brain
- tagging my ideas and finding similar patterns 

## Blogs, thoughts and ideas
Blogs require one tag called “writing” tags. Once I do that I type away what I want to share and publish it directly from bear to my website in markdown format. Read more at bear on how to do this. To read more about tags and how bear is amazing at that, check out [Bear Tags[(https://blog.bear.app/2020/05/getting-started-with-using-and-organizing-tags-in-bear/)

### Why markdown?
A few lessons I learnt from using notion was how your content is not yours and how you can be locked into a product because they make it hard to export content or in this case, notion does have the option of exporting to markdown but not markdown. It is a poor version of markdown that requires effort if you try and import your document in something else making you a prisoner of notion. I can’t understand these days why individual content creators and students, choose notion. I would advise against using it if you are concerned about data privacy, ownership. Notion, these days does not care about you if you are a student, individual user. You do not own your data and hence, Notion is recommended for businesses that can keep on paying team fees yearly. 

This is where bear (and even obsidian) shines. As a markdown first editor, bear makes it super easy to move to other platforms like craft, word, google docs, iA writer, apple notes and even notion. See? That’s what a good product does. It doesn’t lock you in and makes you use it if you want to not because you have to. 

Markdown is supported by almost all the text editors these days and is an excellent way for you to write anything. Besides, speaking of privacy, you can encrypt notes on bear.

### How do I journal on bear? 
I have a complex script using iOS shortcuts that automatically gives a new quote each day, integrates my sleep data from Apple Watch and creates entry with gratitude journaling inputs and shows my calendar events for the day.

All I need to do is tap on the shortcut every morning and write from my mac or iPhone or iPad. It makes life easier. Besides, the notes are automatically tagged to use the current month I don’t have to think about folders or anything. Bear does not folders. It has tags that helps you arrange notes automatically. It was hard to transition to the idea of tags but it has been great. 

### Making bear my second brain
This second brain concept is everywhere. People use notion, obsidian or roam for this purpose but they all lack one common thing. **Speed.**

That’s right. None of them are built natively for the apple ecosystem which makes them slow, laggy and buggy with poor user experience. As a product designer, apps like iA writer or bear, if you haven’t used them, try them out and compare them to notion. The writing experience is far better. If you want to manage databases like notion, look at fancy graphs as to how your ideas are forming patterns like the neurons in your brain, bear is not the app for you. Bear 2.0 that is yet to release sometime this year, has backlinks like obsidian. If obsidian has the speed that bear has, I would switch in an instance because of the graph views. 90% of the time I would be typing away and creating complex workflows, and I feel that speed and good UX is the core need for anyone who is trying to become more productive and automate certain aspects of their digital interactions. 

# What about things app?
#### [Things](https://culturedcode.com/things/) is a project management / GTD tool that can be used across all aspects of your life
![Things gtd](https://benhur.me/img/Bear and Things/Thingsapp.png)

How do I use things?
- Integrating with calendar and using it as a day planner / time blocker 
- Using it with bear 
- Using it for habits and breaking down higher level goals 

Let’s look at each of them one by one. I’m not going to explain what thing 3 is like. There are many cheaper options when compared to things 3 on the market that has more features and better integrations with other apps like your email client. But that’s what makes things a good tool for being productive. 

The key here again is speed. Things is not for people who want a cluttered program that claims to do everything but in a mediocre way. Things is for those who want a minimal task management application that is consistent across apple ecosystem including the widget on the Apple Watch. With things, you focus on one core aspect which is to get things done. I found myself fiddling around with useless features in apps like ticktick, Todoist etc but things has key functions like tags, deadline and start date with reminders and is written in all markdown. You can drag-drop your notes from bear app and make them as to-dos.

Things has quick add functionality that works across your apple devices and all it takes is one simple shortcut to launch a new entry. The sync speed is insane on an Apple Watch even. 

Things has the best sync functionality which means, when you enter something in one device, its instant on another and even works better than iCloud sync. 

### Calendar
The tasks that you create on things can be transferred to iOS calendar and be made as time blocked events. I type out the I need to do to things and choose when to do it. When the day comes, I use my shortcut that opens things and calendar in split view in my mac or iPad Pro and drag the task blogs into calendar. Works flawlessly…

### Using it with bear
When I create a daily journal, there is a section that gets created automatically with to-do check boxes. I have 1-3 pre-created so the tasks that I feel are the most important to be done go there. At the end of the day, no matter how I feel, I make sure to get those three things done at least so I don’t feel like I have wasted a day. We all have days when we feel unproductive and that’s okay.
 
Another iOS shortcut runs at 9:00 am automatically runs that takes these 3 checkboxes and exports them into things for the day as tasks. My interaction with my devices is lower and lower and thanks to these automations. All I have to do is open up my laptop or phone, type in my daily journal and when I start to work, I have all the tasks ready to go and not play around with apps.

All I have to do after my coffee, is look at my things in today’s view and I know those three are the at least  minimum things I need to complete. 

### Integrating my habits in things
Things although is not a habit tracker, it can be used in a similar way without those gamification techniques that makes you feel bad for missing a day when you just feel like shit.

I first sort out my high level goals and break them into a concrete plan with a specific deadline and start date. For example: I want to make it a habit for reading daily while also I have a larger goal of reading 36 books this year. I can break this down into reading 9 books a quarter (3 a month). I can further break this into weeks and there might be some weeks where other things take precedence so we can keep it less than one book / week. 

Now that there is a time frame, I can add individual book names from Goodreads as separate tasks on things with a start date which is a Monday and a deadline which is a Sunday. So every single week, a new book occurs as a task every single day for me to check off thereby always reminding me that I’m reaching / progressing towards the goal. Now I don’t have to be like, not reading for 4 months and reading a lot in one. That’s the crux of atomic habits book.

> Don’t focus on your goals. Focus on the system you are setting to achieve them. -James Clear (Atomic Habits)

Honestly, I’m happy with this workflow and I feel I can optimise it even further. The end goal is to automate and use less apps / products as possible so that my screen time can be reduced but still get all the benefits.
