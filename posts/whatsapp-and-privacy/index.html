Why? Surprisingly, this time, people from all over the world have been seeking for alternative platforms to WhatsApp that has dominated the cross-platform messenger market for 11-years. Let us discuss what are the reasons to switch and why Signal is the best platform to switch to in terms of Privacy, User Control, User Experience and feature sets for the major target audience.\nReasons why people are switching: In 2014, when the social media giant, Facebook announced its acquisition of WhatsApp, millions were alerted to the possibility of it becoming a surveillance and data tracking platform. Despite its founders, Brian Acton and Jan Koum pledging that the platform, even though it will become free from 2016 (yes, WhatsApp used to be 1$/year), it will remain ad-free and will not collect user data for company profits. One question that you need to ask yourself during this period is:\nHow do they make their money?\nOn 2016, WhatsApp was caught sharing user data to its parent company, Facebook that tracked user phone numbers to be used for targeted ads. Later, Facebook acknowledged this and reversed their decision.\nIn 2017, 2018; Both Brian Acton and Jan Koum (Co-founders of WhatsApp) left the company. One could argue that Facebook and would have wanted to use WhatsApp in ways that were not ethical from the two founders point of view.\nNail in the coffin Throughout the years, after the acquisition of Whatsapp, it is of no doubt that Facebook waited for its user base to grow and to make the platform indispensable. Features were added, server costs were made free, platform remained ad-free and End-End encryption was added. Facebook had a plan that was revealed in January 2021 where the social media giant gave an ultimatum to its users.\nWe don’t need your texts. The below data is what we need. Give them to us or don’t use our platform.\nSignal for Privacy When Brian Acton left Whatsapp, you guessed it right. He proceeded to start a non-profit group which was revealed as the Signal Foundation that develops the Signal app that I’m asking you to try out.\nSignal was the first to build open-source End to End encryption on their platform and Whatsapp uses the same encryption model as Signal. It’s safe to say that Signal was built with user privacy and security in mind where WhatsApp was acquired by Facebook as a long term con-game to make users give up their data. They use the business model of free for now, get the users to invest in their platform and then change the privacy policy.\nSignal for User control Have you ever noticed that the platforms which rely on your data to provide them with profits, make it hard for you to delete your account? Signal does not do that and even your backups are encrypted.\nSignal provides you with far more user control that allows you to permanently delete messages and set an expiry on certain messages (like how telegram does it but telegram is closed source meaning no one can audit the code)\nSignal for better User Experience If you have used WhatsApp during 2013, when it was under the hands of people who cared for it, you would have been blown away by the simple and intuitive user experience of the platform.\nWhy do you need to post your stories on 5 different platforms every day is the question you need to ask yourself. A messenger does not need a stories function. The more data you share with WhatsApp, Facebook and Instagram, the easier it is for them to target you with relevant ads.\nSignal does not have bloated functionalities and performs superior as a simple messenger/audio/video platform. It’s simple, intuitive and fun to use with gorgeous animations. Signal supports full cross platform including linux support.\nConclusion At the end of the day, you as a consumer need to ask yourself what are your values and how do your values transpire in the world. The more we depend on big tech companies for our everyday needs, the more power they acquire in return. These organisations are subjective realities in this world. They have the power because we give it to them. As designers, we have a crucial role to play in making platforms that are not only useful, usable, accessible but importantly, regularly check if they are ethical.\n","wordCount":"735","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2021-01-09T17:23:34Z","dateModified":"2021-01-09T17:23:34Z","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://benhur.me/posts/whatsapp-and-privacy/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Benhur","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://benhur.me/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://benhur.me/ accesskey=h title="Benhur (Alt + H)">Benhur</a>
