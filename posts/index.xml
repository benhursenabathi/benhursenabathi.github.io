Today, we are on the verge of breakthroughs across different industries and projects ranging from hydrogen fuel cells, carbon nano-tubes to building space elevators and revolutionising sci-fi ideas around the world.
It‚Äôs fascinating to look back and understand how far our species has come in the last 200 years.
Although sci-fi and the stories we tell ourselves has always been focussed on external aspects of humanity, like space travel, talking to aliens and robots taking over the planet or fighting zombies to save earth, scientifically, it took us many years to understand ourselves better (and we don‚Äôt in many areas).</description></item><item><title>What do the JWST images of outer space mean for humanity?</title><link>https://benhur.me/posts/jwst-humanity/</link><pubDate>Sun, 21 Aug 2022 15:13:15 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://benhur.me/posts/jwst-humanity/</guid><description>They are not ‚Äújust images‚Äù The James Webb Telescope has been in the works for almost two decades. If you‚Äôre interested in astronomy, we are living in one of the most interesting timeframes of human existence. Hubble Space Telescope, JWST‚Äôs older brother has been giving us high quality images of galaxies for a while now. We have gotten used to the blurry, colour corrected images and we have become complacent.</description></item><item><title>Climbing my first Mountain üèî</title><link>https://benhur.me/posts/first-mountain/</link><pubDate>Sat, 25 Jun 2022 21:52:52 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://benhur.me/posts/first-mountain/</guid><description>Off topic This one is going to be an off topic from the usual tech babble that I put up on here. It‚Äôs about the philosophical and experiential approach to conquering something that looks to be impossible on the surface.
The Climb We decided to do a midnight mountain climbing cause why not. Triple the danger and triple the experience right? We started at around 8 PM in summer when the sun was strong and the golden rays were reflecting off the lakes.</description></item><item><title>What Could Meta Bring to the Metaverse Table?</title><link>https://benhur.me/posts/meta/</link><pubDate>Sat, 30 Apr 2022 15:31:56 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://benhur.me/posts/meta/</guid><description>Meta is quickly becoming a new name and is becoming synonymous with the infamous metaverse we all seem to be raving about. It remains to be seen how meta, the former facebook brand is updated with new business models surrounding the metaverse and if it would follow the best ethical and privacy friendly practices it has failed to do so far.
Centralised vs Decentralised metaverses Meta prides itself on building the next generation immersive 3D experiences with avatars for work and leisure.</description></item><item><title>Designing for the next generation mental models</title><link>https://benhur.me/posts/next-generation/</link><pubDate>Thu, 21 Apr 2022 20:27:24 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://benhur.me/posts/next-generation/</guid><description>Designing for the next generation. Think about a time when you taught your parents how to use a smartphone or any digital interface. You probably spent a good chunk of time trying to explain how to get from one screen to the next by tapping on weird blocks that claim they stand for something. Yes, I‚Äôm looking at you, the dot button which has additional options within it that makes no sense but it does now because someone decided so.</description></item><item><title>How can Zero Knowledge Proof be used by Designers to Design for Privacy</title><link>https://benhur.me/posts/zkproof/</link><pubDate>Sat, 16 Apr 2022 15:59:28 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://benhur.me/posts/zkproof/</guid><description>Zero-knowledge Proofs Zero knowledge proofs have been used to make the information that is exchanged on the blockchain anonymous and private. Zero knowledge proofs are mathematical proofing system where the prover (the party who has to prove something) to the verifier (The other party who would verify the statement) without conveying additional information.
The statement being conveyed has to only consist of the fact that the prover knows or possesses the secret rather than telling the whole secret to the verifier or any other third party.</description></item><item><title>How I Created a Digital Second Brain to Optimise Learning</title><link>https://benhur.me/posts/knowledge-management/</link><pubDate>Mon, 04 Apr 2022 21:15:15 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://benhur.me/posts/knowledge-management/</guid><description>Many of us spend a long time on the internet these days, consuming and learning new things only to forget them because there‚Äôs always more new and exciting things to learn about.
In addition to that, we also consume information through various mediums like twitter, podcasts, books, articles and newsletters. It can be hard to keep up with them periodically and when you need that particular piece of information you read a year ago, it can be hard to find it.</description></item><item><title>Why the concept of immersive virtual worlds and metaverses could fail</title><link>https://benhur.me/posts/human-limitations/</link><pubDate>Sun, 03 Apr 2022 00:09:22 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://benhur.me/posts/human-limitations/</guid><description>Recreating figments of reality has been in our DNA The oldest cave paintings that have been discovered so far, dates back to almost 45,000 years ago. We, homosapiens have always been intrigued about the world around us and tried to recreate it in different forms throughout history. Instead of being functional, these paintings tell us that people loved to imitate or even redefine reality.
The earliest forms of writing were found around 5000 years ago in the form of Quipu.</description></item><item><title>How can web3 change the game for designers</title><link>https://benhur.me/posts/web3-and-modern-services/</link><pubDate>Sun, 13 Mar 2022 11:34:28 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://benhur.me/posts/web3-and-modern-services/</guid><description>For the sake of this article, let‚Äôs keep web 3 explanation super simple. Web 3.0‚Äôs decentralised protocol will enable people on the internet to own and be compensated for their time and data of all forms, whereas today, all of these data are being exploited by centralised giants.
We might have seen different posts talk about how this could change our society. While these new dimension of products have hard to understand mechanics and you could lose money due to the poor design language of these platforms.</description></item><item><title>How I use Bear, Things and Apple shortcuts to supercharge productivity</title><link>https://benhur.me/posts/bear-and-things-app/</link><pubDate>Sat, 12 Mar 2022 12:35:25 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://benhur.me/posts/bear-and-things-app/</guid><description>What is bear?

Explorative play gives a sandbox experience for kids to simulate adult life.

It did not know it would mass murder billions of animals for meat, it did not know it had the power to alter the climate and cause widespread destruction on a global scale.
We, humans have evolved to become the dominant species of a planet in a small period when compared to the cosmic timeline.</description></item></channel></rss>
