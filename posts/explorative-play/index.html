Explorative play gives a sandbox experience for kids to simulate adult life. In her book, how emotions are made, Lisa Barett, the psychologist says that 90% of our brain is running on internal simulation and the rest 10% of input from external world. The external stimulus is what the brain uses to test these internal simulations. That in a nutshell is the way that explorative play helps kids become adults and form new mental models and shape their identities.\nA study by Sergio Pellis shows us that mammals, when they play during their formative juvenile years, they show signs of better learning and problem solving characters when they are adults. This also translates to human beings, except we can still keep playing and learning as we grow up, although not at the same pace we could when we were young. This can be seen in the rate of play mindset compared with the age graph below\nThe Explorative Play Process The video of the kid falling down above shows us that children take in the world (10% of external stimulus) as bits pieces before they form any mental models. These fragments can be pieced together, in interesting manners by the brain boosting creativity. For eg: A ketchup bottle is just a ketchup to you, an adult while it can be a rocket ship to a child. One other space this phenomenon of using external stimulus to learn and try new things occurs during the REM phase of sleep (while dreaming).\nWhat is the current state of explorative play? Think about today’s world. Our children are are addicted to a world of online entertainment that lowers the prospects of explorative play while slowly replacing it with media that is designed to make kids consume it passively.\n In fact, research has even shown that there is a 50% decrement in learning and growth when it is done via a screen.\n But, what about open world gaming in digital platforms? They are taking precedence based on recent trends and as a result of pandemic.\nWe still don’t know the long term effects of screen addiction and more and more children are replacing their time outside, exploring, with games that mimic these external experiences.\nDo they still instill the benefits of open, explorative physical play in children we discussed earlier? Are they able to provide the same cognitive, emotional and social benefits when children indulge in casual explorative play?\nThe answer is a hard no. Based on studies done by the american association for pediatrics and Dr. Stuart Brown, they found that we need to interact with the world in 3D with all of our core senses to get the same learning and growth benefits involved in explorative play.\n Is that where extended realities and metaverse comes in? AR/VR are 3D and immersive. Can they replace physical explorative play while providing the same benefits?\n Defining the future of play as a designer Consumer trends show that there is a huge preference for extended reality products, like the quest 2 outselling Xbox Series X in 2021. This is expected to grow until the year 2045, where millions and millions of children and adults alike are expected to use them on a daily basis.\nThe potential risks In addition to online addiction, the metaverse promises interoperability of virtual assets used across different worlds. In doing so, kids could be exposed to spending money and might fall prey to various scams due of the anonymous nature of these worlds.\nRiot games has found that the more anonymous and the more immersive (causing players to disconnect from reality) computer gaming is, the more players resort to cheat and indulge in toxic behaviours.\nWhat are the ethical implications that are overlooked today especially in 2D screen based virtual games? How might we prepare ourselves and design crucial future experiences with governance and guidelines in mind?\nThree key questions to consider for the future:  As more of explorative play, especially for children turning virtual, what would the long term effects be? How can virtual worlds be made to carry on the benefits of physical explorative play? As creatives, we are going to be at the forefront of crafting these products that define explorative play.
