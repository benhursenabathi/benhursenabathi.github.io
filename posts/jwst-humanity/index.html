If you’re interested in astronomy, we are living in one of the most interesting timeframes of human existence. Hubble Space Telescope, JWST’s older brother has been giving us high quality images of galaxies for a while now. We have gotten used to the blurry, colour corrected images and we have become complacent. In order to truly appreciate how great these images are, we have to constantly remind ourselves that out there, something incredible and something big is happening. For the first time in human history we can zoom into these cosmic events and have a clear picture of what is going on. We have finally got to the why behind the what that we have been missing so far. These images have the power to take humanity to next level whether we like it or now. Million years from now, if humanity continues to prosper, we could look back at 2022 and tell ourselves, that was where it all started. Being the explorers we are, where we finally look beyond what is here and what is nearby, but we look at the end. Where space and time itself originated, where we haven’t had the chance to peek so far. It could destroy our fundamental ideas and assumptions of the universe itself.\nlooking inwards and looking outwards We always have looked within us. Historical writings, philosophical teachings all point us to looking inwards. To find meaning, purpose and peace; we are taught to look at ourselves, our fundamental being as human to understand the world around us and to remain sane and happy.\nLearning and knowing about the outer space and the universe changes this fundamental notion. No longer is it enough to look inwards but looking at ourselves as humans, through the lens of the universe is something that everyone needs to experience. Suddenly, we are not significant in any manner. We have been a blip on the cosmic calendar and we will leave no traces of our existence as humans once the universe goes through a heat death. Looking at ourselves not as the all seeing God but as a ever humble, insignificant creature is necessary to cultivate this understanding of cosmic insignificance.\nIn his famous book, 4000 weeks, Time management for mortals, Oliver Burkeman says..\n…it comes as a relief to be reminded of your insignificance: it’s the feeling of realizing that you’d been holding yourself, all this time, to standards you couldn’t reasonably be expected to meet. And this realization isn’t merely calming but liberating, because once you’re no longer burdened by such an unrealistic definition of a “life well spent,” you’re freed to consider the possibility that a far wider variety of things might qualify as meaningful ways to use your finite time.\nOur society, social media and schools are continuously teaching us to look inwards. To become a better person, to become more productive, to be successful, you have to look inwards. If you aren’t doing what we collectively term as “a productive life” you are failing. That’s what we are propagating towards life. Is this the right approach? Would it make sense for us at times, to look outwards? To look at the stars and experience the infinite and cold universe and to understand that few things in life are worth losing sleep over.\nsetting the course for the future These images and further research, powered by JWST could be the first step towards helping us understand what’s out there and looking at the farthest time in the history of the universe. Looking at billions of light years in the past, we could find how it all began. We know all this. We know that every time we look at the stars, we are looking at the past. We are looking at light that was made before our planet even existed. But what about the future? Millions of years from now, these images from JWST could tell a convincing story to our future generations. They could understand that we were and are still explorers. They could understand the passion and zeal that we had for exploring the depths of the universe. Similar to how we look at the archaeological remains of our distant ancestors and tell ourselves, “how did we do that so long ago”, our future generations of cyborg-human race could look back and think of us as primitive, weak human race but still be fascinated about the efforts we put in, to understand the universe around us. They may even be grateful for not destroying ourselves with weapons and set a course for us to become an inter-galactic species.\nThe Kardashev scale and future civilisation looking back The Kardashev scale is a method to measure a civilisation’s technological progress in relation to the amount of energy it uses. Ranging from type 1 to type 6, type 6 being the most omnipotent with powers to manipulate space and time to its will, we might never understand if its possible or who they are. A thought experiment could go like, we could be the ancestors of the future civilisations that are able to achieve type 6 status on the Kardashev scale. Our explorations in the form of the voyager spacecraft, Cassini, Mars’s rover missions and JWST could be the first steps and the foundation towards something greater.. something, bigger than humanity itself. These missions at cosmic scale, whether you and I are forgotten or not, will withstand millions and millions of years. The voyager spacecraft is already in deep space and we have no power to destroy it. It is going to be humanity’s talisman for millions and millions of years. Similarly, the information, data and images from JWST could be the documentation, could be similar to the Greek and Roman manuscripts or fossil fuels from dinosaurs. We cannot know what they were like, but we can hypothesise and extrapolate outcomes.\nType 6 civilisations in the future, billions of years from now, could still hold onto these digital data from JWST, look at it and learn more about its own history. In a sense, we become the distant, cosmic ancestors of these civilisations of the future.\n","wordCount":"1040","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2022-08-21T15:13:15+01:00","dateModified":"2022-08-21T15:13:15+01:00","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://benhur.me/posts/jwst-humanity/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Benhur","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://benhur.me/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://benhur.me/ accesskey=h title="Benhur (Alt + H)">Benhur</a>
