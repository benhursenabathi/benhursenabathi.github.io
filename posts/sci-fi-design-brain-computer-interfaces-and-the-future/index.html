Today, we are on the verge of breakthroughs across different industries and projects ranging from hydrogen fuel cells, carbon nano-tubes to building space elevators and revolutionising sci-fi ideas around the world.\nIt’s fascinating to look back and understand how far our species has come in the last 200 years.\nAlthough sci-fi and the stories we tell ourselves has always been focussed on external aspects of humanity, like space travel, talking to aliens and robots taking over the planet or fighting zombies to save earth, scientifically, it took us many years to understand ourselves better (and we don’t in many areas). The human condition, as humans, we are new to the idea of learning and understanding ourselves better. Over the last few years, this has been changing. We have revolutionised our understanding of our biological systems, building blocks and decoding the neural networks in our brain. Today, we can see build entire neural networks and produce neural activity from skin cells.\nThis curiosity to understand ourselves better and break-down our biological make up with the help of science has permeated in designing complex brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). Sci-fi writings and movies have focussed on integrating the technology ecosystem to the human ecosystem thereby giving birth to a cohesive, adaptable and biologically superior and enhanced humanoids.\nThe role of Science Fiction Cyborgs and integrating artificial intelligent systems into our biological human bodies are nothing new. We have been exploring these ideas for thousands of years. We started to use technology externally from our bodies, attach and detach them when needed to help make our lives better, faster and easier.\nRecently, with new research in integrated technologies - sci-fi books, games and movies are starting to focus on integrating oneself with a technology layer for various purposes. Exploring new worlds, escaping the prison of our genetics and becoming superhuman are all included in these utopian worlds. Like every important discovery in the history of mankind, science fiction will be the key factor in exploring the next phase of our biological evolution.\nCyberpunk 2077 Cyberpunk 2077 is a video game set in the fictional city of Night City, where the line between humanity and technology has become blurred. The game is set in a dystopian future where advanced technology and artificial intelligence have become integral parts of daily life.\nIt is set in a world where artificially enhancing our biological bodies with cybernetics, nanobots and chips are normal. These can enhance our cognitive, muscular, optics and core-biological functions. The game tries to paint a nihilistic view point of the human condition that suffering is our fate and we have to find meaning in it while hinting that fusing ourselves with artificial intelligence could put an end to the suffering of daily life.\nIt tells us that in 2077, the world will be run by corporations and if you are not enhanced using biochips or cyberware, you will be on the lowest tiers of society itself.\nCyberpunk imagines a “what if” world where our interactions with technologies and computers become demanding that we decide to fuse ourselves with artificial intelligence and lose powers over our conscious minds. It shows a dystopian side of the human-computer interaction where we become dependant on integrated biochips like we are with our extended biochips (mobile phones) It’s up to you, the reader to think if this is possible. In addition to cyberpunk, there are many other sci-if examples like The Foundation trilogy, Bladerunner, Altered-Carbon, Ex-machina and many others which toy with these ideas. This sounds crazy on first thoughts and rightly so. After all, they’re just science fiction.\nLet’s look at real-world examples that might be a stepping stone to a cyberpunk world.\nBrain-Computer Interfaces Brain computer interfaces (BCIs) are devices that allow the brain to communicate directly with a computer or other external device. They work by detecting and interpreting the brain’s electrical signals, and using them to control external devices or perform various tasks.\nOne potential application of BCIs is in the field of prosthetics. For example, a person with a prosthetic limb could use a BCI to control the movements of the limb, allowing them to walk, pick up objects, and perform other tasks more naturally. BCIs could be used to help people with paralysis or other disabilities regain a certain degree of control over their movements.\nAnother potential application of BCIs is in the field of gaming and entertainment. Imagine being able to control a virtual reality game or experience simply by thinking about it. BCIs could also be used to enhance other forms of entertainment, such as music and movies, by allowing people to directly experience and interact with the content in a more immersive way. This is the future that sci-fi writers and Neuralink are pushing for.\nNeuralink Few years back, we started to get good with brain imaging technologies we could understand what parts of our brain are in use when we go through different emotions, memory consolidation, temperature regulation and more. We started to understand ourselves better which was the missing piece in our human-curiosity puzzle.\nCue to 2022, Neuralink demoed a subject monkey named Sake, typing on a full qwerty style keyboard using nothing but its mind. On the presentation, Elon Musk went forward to say that this technology in the future, could allow people to control their phones (or any gadgets) through their mind with a chip implant and it would be faster than using our hands or legs. Thinking about that for a second, you can understand that the hands are the middleman here. With this technology, in the future, your electrical neural activity in your brain could directly, wirelessly communicate bi-directionally with a computer.\nSuddenly, the cyberpunk world looks like it will be here before 2077. Within a span of a century, from trying to understand ourselves better, imagining worlds where we communicate directly with machines to finally building these symbiotes that could push us to the next stage of our human evolution, science has pushed the boundaries.\nFrom Sapiens, Homo Deus and in his recent book, 21 lessons for the 21st century, Yuval Noah Harari emphasises that the fusion of biotechnoloy and information technology will be the biggest revolution of this century and proposes the question, are we ready for it?\nWhat does this mean for us, human-centred designers? It is important for designers to consider the impact that these technologies will have on individuals and society as a whole. Human-centered designers strive to create products and experiences that are intuitive, user-friendly, and enhance people’s lives in meaningful ways. What / whom are we designing for when technology interfaces are a part of the human experience?\nWhen designing for technologies such as brain-computer interfaces and chip implants, it is important for designers to consider the ethical implications of these technologies, as well as the potential risks and benefits to the user. They should also be mindful of the potential impact on society and consider how these technologies may affect issues such as privacy and security.\nDesigning for these technologies will require designers to think creatively and consider new ways of interacting with devices and systems. How could we prototype ideas and test them? Would these new interfaces be unique to each individual? What would the business and technical constraints look like?\nIn the futuristic space game, high-on-life, the player looks at ads from corporations when they wear a space combat suit that is on trial-mode. It may require designers to work closely with experts in fields such as neuroscience and ethics to ensure that we are designing products and experiences that are safe, ethical, and beneficial to the user. The goal of human-centered design is to create technology that enhances people’s lives and helps them achieve their goals, and this is no less true when designing for technologies such as brain-computer interfaces and chip implants.\nAnother major concern is the issue of privacy and security. Chip implants and BCIs have the potential to collect and transmit large amounts of personal data, which could be accessed by hackers or used for malicious purposes. Designers and other specialists must ensure that the interfaces they design are secure and protect users’ privacy. They should consider how to give users control over their data and the ability to opt out of certain features if they wish. Imagine the usage of dark UX patterns on a brain-computer interface to make additional revenue.\nAnother ethical concern is the potential for these technologies to be used to exploit or manipulate users. For example, BCIs could be used to manipulate people’s thoughts and emotions, or chip implants could be used to monitor and control people’s behavior. Designers must ensure that the interfaces they design do not enable or facilitate these kinds of abuses, and that they give users the ability to control how the technology is used.\nThere are also concerns around accessibility and inclusion. Some people may not be able to use BCIs or chip implants due to physical or cognitive limitations, or due to financial or social barriers. Designers must consider these issues and strive to create interfaces that are accessible and inclusive for all users.\n","wordCount":"1538","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2022-12-02T09:42:38Z","dateModified":"2022-12-02T09:42:38Z","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://benhur.me/posts/sci-fi-design-brain-computer-interfaces-and-the-future/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Benhur","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://benhur.me/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://benhur.me/ accesskey=h title="Benhur (Alt + H)">Benhur</a>
