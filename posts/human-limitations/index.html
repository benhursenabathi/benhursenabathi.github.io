We, homosapiens have always been intrigued about the world around us and tried to recreate it in different forms throughout history. Instead of being functional, these paintings tell us that people loved to imitate or even redefine reality.\nThe earliest forms of writing were found around 5000 years ago in the form of Quipu. Quipu was a method used by Incan civilisation using knotted strings to collect data, noting down information and monitoring taxes. We found different ways to communicate reality through language and writing techniques.\nFor most of human history, different cultures have used different methods and materials that were locally available to them. They all had one goal however, that was to project their understanding of the world in a format that others could understand and share a sense of belonging. To them, those were the best possible immersive experiences they could create with the limited set of tools. They did not have an iPhone with HDR to capture and share reality.\nEvolution of defining reality As we evolved through the years, painting, art, architecture evolved with us. Suddenly we were able to create exquisite sculptures with different stones in three-dimensions, we constructed monuments that redefined the nature of reality of outer worlds. They started to tell a story, a very convincing one and many of these has withstood the sands of time.\nWe started to get better at defining the world in a more “realistic sense”. 1000 years ago, the phenomenon of a camera obscura (dark room) to capture light was understood by Alhazen, an Arab scientist. Fast forward to 17th century, this same principle was used to create portable cameras that served to capture images and help in drawing. We started to better “trap reality” and become more refined. We were not limited to nature and physics of the universe to give us permission as to what we created because we could trap moments in time itself and recreate reality.\nFast forward to today, audio and video are effortless. The computer on your pocket is faster than the ones used for Apollo’s moon landing. We are at the technological peak of capturing reality even in motion, redefining it and telling our own story. We made these stories more immersive with real-time audio or attached our own forms of audio to tell new stories about the world we live in.\nThen gaming arrived. Immersive worlds where you are not bound by physical rules was a new way where designers and developers crafted worlds that were once thought to be impossible. You could do anything in these worlds, and we have seen over the last 20 years, the improvement in graphical capabilities has paved way for life-like 3D textures and environment design.\nFor the first time in history, we are not only recreating and capturing real-worlds but actively creating parallel universes that feel even more immersive. there is an estimate of around 3 Billion gamers world wide.\nIt shows how much, we as humans want to experience and be immersed in these virtual worlds because they are capable of offering much more than traditional paintings, writing and taking pictures. Because, you were always limited by the laws of physics before. Modern games are the peak immersive experiences we have conjured so far.\nEvolution, you say? What is the DMN? Though we have gotten better at capturing, redefining and crafting experiences and moments from reality, we are losing a few things that is key to human wellbeing.\nWe continuously crave novel experiences within a short time period due to the ubiquitous nature of these technologies. In his book, digital minimalism, Cal Newport references Matthew Lieberman’s studies on “default mode network” They found out that there are certain regions of the brain that gets activated when we don’t do anything (day dreaming) and devoid ourselves with any cognitive tasks. These areas are collectively called “DMN - default mode network” which has been found to practice our social and emotional thinking during these downtimes.\nWe are biologically wired to take downtimes and to day dream, that is directly beneficial to our mental wellbeing.\nSleep We are living in an age where sleep is being demonised. Sleep is thought to be unproductive whereas every research done on the topic concludes the opposite. In his book, Matthew Walker outlines key benefits of sleep like immune functions, ability to form memories, mental models and even avoid Alzheimer’s later on in life.\nIncreased screen time through blue light devices has been a major concern in today’s world as it has been one of the highest factors in sleep disruption. As we pivot to more and more of immersive technologies like the metaverse for work, play, socialising, what would be long term effects on sleep be?\nPhysical activity According to WHO, 1 in 4 adults do not take part in enough physical activity and around 5 million deaths each year could be avoided due to this. Imagine what would be the scenario as working from home becomes more favourable, connecting and socialising through virtual worlds takes precedence over meeting in person and playing virtual games would be the only form of socialising you ever do.\nThis might sound insane and implausible but social media took over the definition of connection in a decade. What would the world look like as more and more immersive virtual worlds take precedence and become the definition for connection compared to meeting in-real-life or even sending a message on social media.\nIt wont. In my opinion, it won’t be possible for us to be immersed and stay within these virtual worlds for all our tasks. From collaborating on projects to building a skyscraper in a virtual world, the human body does not have the necessary resources yet to fully accommodate this massive shift in how we experience the world. The smartphone era has already shifted our habits and mental models, and we are at the brink of what we can do from a biological standpoint.\nThink of your days when you are stuck in meetings. You would’ve felt exhausted looking at your computer screen 30 cm away (hopefully) and you just want to sleep or go for a run at five. Today, we encourage schools to take the same approach with virtual classes without thinking about the long term biological effects on children. At a certain point, the human brain just tells, no thank you! I’m tired and need some fresh air. Until now, the advantages of mobile phones have always been portability and disposability. The new generation devices challenges this and requires to be with us during work, play and even sleep. We are finally at a stage where we are willing to negatively affect our biological functions to get more work done and to experience more, be more productive and collaborate and create more projects.\nIt is for this biological limitation, that I point out that, for these new technologies to offer solutions to all parts of our lives (socialising, working, communicating, learning) is useless. You cannot start your day looking at 5 screens while your co-workers are avatars with brand new Nike shoes and also finishing work and travelling to Egypt in the metaverse to meet some friends. It will be possible and sounds really cool, but when it comes to it, irrespective of how “real” it feels like, you and I have serious biological limitations as to how much we can do. We cannot extend every aspect of our lives virtually like the technologists say we can because we are thinking in terms of what the technology CAN do not what the human mind and body is able to.\nDevil’s advocate As always, maybe we will find a way to enhance ourselves to support using these new technologies. What if we could learn and explore during sleep? How would that look like? What if we create nano bots that artificially exercises our muscles and fill our dopamine pathways to make us feel refreshed?\nWhat if we create a bio film for our eyes that can protect us from extended reality screens. We have become good as a species with creating problems, challenging our human body and pushing it to its limits and then coming up with solutions for those challenges.\n","wordCount":"1399","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2022-04-03T00:09:22+01:00","dateModified":"2022-04-03T00:09:22+01:00","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://benhur.me/posts/human-limitations/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Benhur","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://benhur.me/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://benhur.me/ accesskey=h title="Benhur (Alt + H)">Benhur</a>
