Think about a time when you taught your parents how to use a smartphone or any digital interface. You probably spent a good chunk of time trying to explain how to get from one screen to the next by tapping on weird blocks that claim they stand for something. Yes, I’m looking at you, the dot button which has additional options within it that makes no sense but it does now because someone decided so.\nThe reason you, Despite being younger than your parents, are able to effortlessly teach them how to interact with digital interfaces is because you have developed better mental models over the years of using a TV, Radio, Nokia phones (diamonds) and smartphones. Year after year, designers like us redefined what a particular block or element should look like and what it means for the user. We slowly taught and learnt ourselves thereby upgrading our mental models. Since our parents did not have this progressive mental model training, they find it harder to associate actions with different outcomes and predict what would happen if they tapped on certain elements on screen. It takes them considerably longer to train their mental models because they are transitioning from paper based form of interactive information models.\nOur generation, we like to think that we would continue to be experts as designer but we are under Cognitive Fluency Bias.\nIt can be explained as people prefer things that are easy to think about rather than things that are difficult to think about. This feeling of ease or difficulty is known as cognitive fluency. The ease with which our brains process information. The easier information is to process, the more we are inclined to like it, find it attractive, and believe it to be true.\nInformation becomes easier when we develop progressive mental models. This makes it easy for us designers, who are well trained with these digital interaction models, to forget the people who might not be well trained (old people and people with disabilities) and not push the boundaries for further innovation for younger audience who are malleable to new forms of models.\nHaving the awareness that what you design, is not only for you and people like you, but people with different spectrum of mental models is key. Only by having this awareness, can you find the empathy to look for interaction solutions that caters to teach new models or train on existing ones.\nThe first word processor was a vertical innovation phenomenon as explained by Peter Thiel that was inspired from a typewriter but removed the need for one. People who are older than 40 today, your mental models of using a keyboard to interact with a computer grew slowly by playing around with a typewriter or simpler forms of word processor. It was the foundational code for your neural network to understand this new form of social interaction. This fluency helped us, a generation of users to build and develop the internet, to create icons, to create guidelines and systems and architect how people will interact with technology; but there is a time when the next vertical leap will happen.\nThat would mean, users with current mental models will find it harder to keep up except a few. We are creatures of familiarity and we don’t like too much change. Today’s children would have never used or even seen a typewriter from the late 90s. They started interacting with technology and their peers using modern emojis, virtual avatars and open world gaming. Their mental models stem from something that is drastically different from what we even thought was possible when we were kids.\nAsk yourself, almost every child that we see today is more intelligent than we were at their age. It’s obvious they had an earlier start to consume information and media in high fidelity. They use voice as a primary means to interact with digital products whereas we use touch and type more. The way they think, interact and expect how things work is drastically different. They started interacting with flat design interfaces while we needed skeuomorphic design to help us transition between worlds.\nThe finish line is different for children not because they started late, but because it is a different race.\nThe role in Design User Centred Design is no longer something that is an afterthought. It is fundamental to how you think about a product. When we started interacting with these technologies, we started with the intention of getting a particular work done or solving a problem (like the word processor being insanely cluttered and poorly designed but it got work done)\nThe bar was low and we did not look for meaning or delight in products. Today, meaning and delight is what is going to make or break a product. It does not matter if you are delivering groceries or launching reusable rockets.. Meaningful and delightful products are a basic expectation since our mental models for products has developed.\nIf you want to read more about like, check out this book called Overcrowded where the author talks about new generation of mental models and the expectation of meaning and delight in digital products, a necessity.\nAs we progress, new forms of technology for payments, social media, gaming and shopping will demand even greater human and planet centred elements in it.\nAs kids these days have started cultivating a preference for meaningfully and thoughtfully designed products, their expectations will be at an all time high. They will not have patience for products that just work. You and I might find it okay to just get something done but that was our mental model when we were kids. Do not expect the future generations to think the same way.\n","wordCount":"962","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2022-04-21T20:27:24+01:00","dateModified":"2022-04-21T20:27:24+01:00","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://benhur.me/posts/next-generation/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Benhur","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://benhur.me/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://benhur.me/ accesskey=h title="Benhur (Alt + H)">Benhur</a>
